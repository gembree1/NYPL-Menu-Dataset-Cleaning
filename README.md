The goal of this exercise was to execute an end to end data cleaning workflow.  In order to complete this exercise we utilized tools including Python, OpenRefine, SQLite, YesWorkflow and to pre-process, clean, organize, and describe our data cleaning process.  This was a collaborative effort with Calvin Wong.
